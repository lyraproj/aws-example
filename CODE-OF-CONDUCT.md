# Code of Conduct for Lyra

While we have specific guidelines for various tools (see links below), in general, you should:

-   **Be nice**: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. No offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; no sexual images in public spaces, real or implied violence, intimidation, oppression, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention will be tolerated.
-   **Encourage diversity and participation**: Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.
-   **Keep it legal**: Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break the law.
-   **Stay on topic**: Make sure that you are posting to the correct online channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Also remember that nobody likes spam.

Guideline violations --- 3 strikes method
-----

The point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we do need a fair way to deal with people who do harm to our community. Extreme violations of a threatening, abusive, destructive, or illegal nature will be addressed immediately and are not subject to 3 strikes.

1.  **First occurrence**: We'll give you a friendly, but public, reminder that the behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.
2.  **Second occurrence**: We'll send you a private message with a warning that any additional violations will result in removal from the community.
3.  **Third occurrence**: Depending on the violation, we might need to delete or ban your account.

Notes:

-   Obvious spammers are banned on first occurrence. If we don’t do this, we’ll have spam all over the place.
-   People who are committing minor formatting / style infractions will get some education, rather than hammering them in the 3 strikes process.
-   Contact lyra@puppet.com to report abuse or appeal violations.

### Getting technical help

Filing an issue in the GitHub repo is the best way to seek out technical help.

### Issue guidelines

You can log issue and bug reports for Lyra by filing issues against [the repository](https://github.com/lyraproj/lyra/issues).

Here are a few guidelines that apply specifically to filing issues:

-   Each report is for only one issue. If you find several issues, please separate them into several reports.
-   Search before you file an issue, and try to avoid filing duplicates by taking a look at whether your issue has already been filed before.
-   Don't start debates on topics not directly related to the scope of a specific issue. Create another issue.
-   Remove unnecessary lines when quoting other comments.
-   Please double check to make sure that the information you are including is public (not confidential), especially in attached log files or screenshots.

### Git / source guidelines

-   If you want to contribute code, start with a discussion on a pull request or issue to make sure that what you want to submit is a good idea and architected in a way that will be useful for others.
-   Look at existing pull requests and issues to make sure that you aren’t duplicating effort.
-   Review any existing CONTRIBUTOR.MD files associated with the project.
-   If you are new to git or GitHub, you might find these resources useful: [GitHub help files](http://help.github.com/), [Git cheat sheets](http://help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets/), and [Git Reference documentation](http://gitref.org/).
